Renders the container for the location tree navigation in the Sample Control app.

This template serves as the entry point for the entire tree. It iterates
through the provided locations and only renders the top-level ones (those
without an effective parent), including the `_location_tree_item.html`
partial to handle the recursive rendering of the entire hierarchy.

Context Variables:
  - locations: A queryset or list of all Location objects to be displayed.

            {% include 'sample_control/partials/_location_tree_item.html' with location=location %}
