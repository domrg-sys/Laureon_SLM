Renders the space grid for a specific location in the Sample Control app.

This template acts as a simple wrapper that includes the more specific
`_sample_space_grid.html` partial, passing the necessary context to it.
This separation keeps the templates organized and reusable.

Context Variables:
  - selected_location: The Location object instance whose grid is being displayed.
                       This is passed to the child template as `parent_location`.
  - grid: The 2D list representing the grid of spaces for the location.
