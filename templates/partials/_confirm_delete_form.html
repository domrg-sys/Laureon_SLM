{% comment %}
A reusable partial for rendering a deletion confirmation form.

This template provides a consistent user interface for confirming the deletion
of any object in the application.

Context Variables:
  - object_type: The type of object being deleted (e.g., "Location Type").
  - object_name: The name of the specific object instance being deleted.
  - cancel_url: The URL to redirect to if the user cancels the action.
{% endcomment %}

<p>
    Are you sure you want to delete the {{ object_type }}:
    <strong>{{ object_name }}</strong>?
</p>
<p>This action cannot be undone.</p>

<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <div class="form-actions">
        <a href="{{ cancel_url }}" class="btn btn-gray">Cancel</a>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-red">Confirm Delete</button>
    </div>
</form>
